**Theme:** Health-Tech & Social Impact  

POSTURA acts as a preventive health-tech solution by promoting posture awareness before long-term back and spinal problems develop.

## Problem Statement
Poor posture due to prolonged sitting leads to back pain, fatigue, and long-term musculoskeletal issues, especially among students and desk workers.

## Our Solution
POSTURA is worn on the upper back and continuously monitors posture using motion sensors.  
It automatically calibrates to the user’s correct sitting posture and provides vibration feedback when unhealthy slouching is detected.
